# Server Stats Script

A simple shell script (`server-stats.sh`) that analyzes and displays basic Linux server performance statistics.  
This script can be run on most Linux servers and provides insights into CPU, memory, disk usage, and the top resource-consuming processes.

---

## Features

The script displays the following:

1. **Total CPU Usage** (as a percentage)
2. **Total Memory Usage** (Free vs Used, including percentage)
3. **Total Disk Usage** (Free vs Used, including percentage)
4. **Top 5 Processes by CPU usage**
5. **Top 5 Processes by Memory usage**
